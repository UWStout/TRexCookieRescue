SVG files (Vector image format) are not natively supported in Unity. To add support, follow these steps:

Go to Window > Package Manager
Under the Advanced tab, select "Show preview packages"
In the search bar, type "vector", and "Vector Graphics" should show up in the side bar
Select "Vector Graphics" and click the Install button in the lower right corner

This should add support for the file format that we're using. If the package magically gets included through Github pulls, then you can ignore this file.
